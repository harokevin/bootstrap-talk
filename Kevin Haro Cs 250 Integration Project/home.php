			<p>
				The purpose of this project is to create the structure for a physics equation calculator. This webpage will contain multiple equations that are commonly encountered in physics. For example, the equations that will be included will be basic kinematic equations (velocity as a function of time, displacement as a function of time, velocity as a function of displacement, and displacement as a function velocity and time).
				<br/><br/>The problem that this project addresses is one of my own. I often enter the same expressions into my calculator when working on physics homework. I am to the point where I have memorized the formulas and I would like to be able to easily enter the number and for the webpage to return a result.
				<br/><br/>The value of my website isnâ€™t much for the average person but some of the peers in my physics class may find it useful. Additionally, this project will be a significant contribution to my resume once completed. To make my webpage as efficient as possible I will review the other equation websites and apply the desirable qualities of those sites to my project while also eliminating the bad qualities.
